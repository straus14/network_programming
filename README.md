# network_programming

Codes are developed when I was studying at RWTH and taking course of networking programming lab.

It includes, 5 lab exercises and a final project.

Final project involves the development of network emulation tool, which emulated the INTERNET itself interms of packet loss, packet delay, out of order packet etc. Further statistics are documented for protocols such as UDP and TCP.

Tools such as iPerf, wireshark are used to generate and analyse the traffic respectively.
